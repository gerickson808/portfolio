		<h3>Who is he?</h3>
		<p>Born and raised in Hawaii, Gus has been living on the East Coast for most of the last 10 years. Always a nerd, he one day realized how much he had enjoyed coding on the occasions he had delved into it, and decided to pursue it more seriously. After 6 months of self-teaching using wonderful online resources like <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, he left his job at an insurance agency to attend <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com">Fullstack Academy of Code</a> in New York and pursue an intensive education in web software development. At Fullstack he worked to create multiple projects focused primarily on the MEAN stack, which includes MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and AngularJS. When not coding, Gus loves to surf, but he can also be found snowboarding, cooking, working out, or tackling a new video game.</p>
